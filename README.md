This is a repository for the course project for the course Getting and Cleaning Data as part of the Data Science Specialization. 
==================================================================
Cleaning and Getting Data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 0.1
==================================================================
Juan Sebastian Jaramillo 

==================================================================

The analysis made here follow the outlines of the course project in Getting and Cleaning Data, from the database 
of the Human Activity Recognition using Smartphones. This code cleans the data, extract the variables of means and
standard deviations of the different measurements made along the test and train sets. After that it gets the average
of each variable by each activity and subject. 

This repo includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.md'

- 'Codebook.md': The codebook of the output from the code in 'run_analysis.R'

- 'run_analysis.R': The analysis made on the dataset of the smartphones. 


Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
